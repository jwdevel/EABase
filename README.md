# Updates for EABase

This repository contains updates to EABase..
I would gladly welcome some or all of it to be merged back into upstream[1], but in the meantime I am making it available here.

My changes are available under the same BSD 3-clause license as the EASTL, or the MIT license, whichever you prefer.


* [1] I cannot submit PRs to the [main project](https://github.com/electronicarts/EABase) because I do not wish to sign the EA Contributor License Agreement (CLA). I do not wish to sign the CLA because it requires a real name and address.
